## About the project

  FlappyBird like game created with Unity Engine. The sprites and font were downloaded from asset store. With the given sprites we've created 3 animations for 3 different scenarios i.e. Idle, Die and Flap.
  
  For the columns was created a prefab so that we could add columns later. For infinite or endless gameplay were used 2 background sprites which are translated when needed.
  
  For displaying the score we use a child window containing a text for the current score which equals the number of passed columns.
  
  The assets and executable of the project can be found here https://github.com/Wazea/FlappyBird. To start the game use FB.exe.
